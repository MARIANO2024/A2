			<h2>Subtheme: Exclusionary Zoning
				
			</h2>

			<h3>Overall Analysis Questions</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Are there any alarming holes or issues on the dataset? [Fig 1, Fig 2,Fig 5] SOURCE: Lectures from Week 2 regarding exploratory data visualization.</li>
				<li>Is there a pattern between youth population and single family zoned areas? [Figure 3] SOURCE: Talking to family members who agree with single 
					family zoning who said youth saftey was a concern</li>
				<li>Is there a pattern with percentage of wealthy population and areas with single family zoned areas? [Figure 4] SOURCE: This questions was inspired 
					by the Tiny Living article that seemed to stress not altering the "look" of suburbs which to me sounded like a subtle way saying, making places "not look poor".</li>
				<li>Where are white people distributed in Boston, and what type of housing do they usually live in. [ Figure 6] SOURCE: During Week 1 Lectures, the videos played 
					seemed to hint at the fact that part of the origin of the housing crisis was segregation. </li>

				Missing Population Count in Burlingotn, Chelsea, Everett, and Somerville. According to the Census Burea Website, 
				Sumerville had a population of 75,754 people in 2010. Thus, some data seems to be missing. Additionally the count 
				for population seems to be unreasonably low.

				<figcaption>
				UPDATE on Figure 1: The data set was fixed by staff, and this is reflected on the fact every Municpal name has some count. 
				Additionally, the population count is in an order of magnitude that is reasonable. 
				</figcaption>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/pop_comp_u18.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" />
				<figcaption>
				This map comparison allows us to see that a lot of areas that only allow for single family housing align with places with 
				a high ratio of under 18 population. Note: The %U18 is a Calculated Field.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/O200_map.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" />
				<figcaption>
				This map shows the ratio of house holds that earn more than $200,000 [%O200] and comparing them with the single 
				family only map. We can see that there is a strong relationship between the two. Most notable, 
				Sudbury is a Municpal area where more than 90% of households earn more than $200,000 dollars a year. Note that 
				Wellesley Municipal has been excluded for reasons explained in Figure 5. Note: The %O200 is a Calculated Field.
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<figure>
				<img src="images/error_1.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure shows how the ratio of households earning more than $200,000 is greater than 1 in Wellesley, which does not make 
				sense.More confusiingly, the quantities used to calculate this ratio (over 200k households / total households ) should yield a result 
				less than 1. Since I was not able to really get to why this is ocurring, I excluded this Municpal area from any household calculations.

				<img src="images/white.png" alt="" width="800" height="500" />
				<figcaption>
				This figure, we can observe that the predominantly white areas are outside of Boston, and very present in areas with single-familiy only zoning. 
				Note: The %Avg_White is a Calculated Field.

			<h2>Summary</h2>

			<p> Firstly, it was really useful to examine the population data in its simplest form (as a frequency diagram) 
				as it allowed me to quickly spot major errors in the data set regarding the census part of the data. 
				As far as the exploratory process, it was useful to create Calculated Fields for ratios rather than compare raw numbers. 
				Especially beacuse the dataset's population is heavily skewed towards Boston, so not talking in terms of percents or ratios 
				would have probably made every visualization seem Boston-centric. As far as trends that can be observed from this 
				data set and the figures above, it is clear that the areas with single family only zoning are dominated by 
				wealthy, white, young famlilies (young meaning they have a high ratio of Under 18 population).
